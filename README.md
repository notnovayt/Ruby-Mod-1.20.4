Hello!

This is a Minecraft Mod which I originally created for adding the Ruby to the game, but it branched out and now I add other cool stuff along with rubies!

This mod is for Fabric 1.20.4. I may update it to newer versions of Minecraft later.

# HOW TO USE:
Just place the .jar file from the released to the mods folder in your .minecraft

You shouldn't have any mod conflicts as I've tested it with Sodium, Iris, and a bunch of other performance mods.

# Additions:

The image shows all the stuff that has been added to the game by this mod!
